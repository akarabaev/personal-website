# Personal website

Single-page site. No build step.

- Replace placeholder text in `index.html` with your name, short bio, experience, skills, projects, and Medium links.
- Add your photo as `photo.jpg` in this folder (square works best; it’s shown as a circle).
- Add your CV as `cv.pdf` in this folder (same level as `index.html`).

Open `index.html` in a browser or use a local server, e.g. `python3 -m http.server 8000` then visit http://localhost:8000.
